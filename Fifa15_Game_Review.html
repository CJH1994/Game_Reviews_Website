      <p>Fifa 15 is the latest release in the ultimate Fifa series. Released on 25th September in Europe, this game offers enhanced gameplay & more licenses 
          than ever before! Here i will go through the different aspects of the game, offering my opinion and will rate the game under the different sections, enjoy!</p>
      <br>
      
      <p>Screen User Interface</p>
      
      <p>When you load the game up you will find that the menu screen has identical functionality and layout to its predecessor, Fifa 14. You have the different tabs along the top
      which act as main headings for different sections i.e. customise tab displays many sections such as 'edit teams' and 'profile' etc. Just like Fifa 14, you use the right-analogue
      stick to scroll through different options on the various sections, the only real difference between Fifa 15 and 14 in this general area is the actual colour scheme used.
      <br>
      I would say that this continuity in the design of the game is a good thing. Keeping things similar to the predecessor means that what we players got used to on last years game is the same
      for this one, which avoids confusion and the need to learn the UI all over again.</p>
